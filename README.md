# HelloAndroid

An introductory Android app that uses a button-press event to say hello <name> to the user, based on what name the user has entered into the input field. Explored everything from Gradle builds, Android Studio all the way to intents, filters, logging and integration of third-party libraries such as Butter Knife (for event handling).
